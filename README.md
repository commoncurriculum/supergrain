# Supergrain

Reactive state management for React — with an API query layer built on top.

- **[@supergrain/kernel](./packages/kernel)** is the state library. Read and mutate plain objects; only the components that actually touched the changed property re-render.
- **[@supergrain/silo](./packages/silo)** is an API query layer built on top. Request-batched by default, Suspense-compatible, typed by model. Fetched documents live in the same reactive graph as the rest of your state.

On [Krauset's js-framework-benchmark](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html), Supergrain ties raw `useState` (1.52 weighted) and beats every other state library — RxJS, Zustand, MobX, Redux, Valtio.

## State: `@supergrain/kernel`

Mutate state directly. No actions, no reducers, no selectors, no `useMemo` / `useCallback` dance.

```tsx
import { tracked, useReactive, For } from "@supergrain/kernel/react";

const TodoList = tracked(() => {
  const state = useReactive({
    todos: [
      { id: 1, text: "Ship it", done: false },
      { id: 2, text: "Sleep", done: true },
    ],
  });

  return (
    <For each={state.todos}>
      {(todo) => (
        <li onClick={() => (todo.done = !todo.done)}>
          {todo.done ? "✓" : "○"} {todo.text}
        </li>
      )}
    </For>
  );
});
```

Click a todo and only that one `<li>` re-renders. Not the list. Not the siblings. No keys, no memoization.

`useReactive` is for component-scoped state; `createStore` is for app-wide state with a Provider. Writes are synchronous (read your own writes immediately); deep mutations (`store.org.teams[0].active = true`) are tracked at any nesting depth.

## Queries: `@supergrain/silo`

An entity cache with request batching. Think TanStack Query, except the fetched documents are reactive state you can also mutate directly — one cache, not two.

```tsx
import { useDocument } from "@supergrain/silo/react";

function UserCard({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const user = useDocument("user", id);

  if (user.isPending) return <Skeleton />;
  if (user.error) return <ErrorState error={user.error} />;
  return <div>{user.data?.attributes.firstName}</div>;
}
```

Render 50 `<UserCard>`s in one pass and they collapse into a single `adapter.find(ids)` call. The handles are reactive: a later `store.insertDocument("user", updated)` (socket push, mutation response, admin edit) re-renders just the cards whose data changed — no query keys, no `invalidateQueries`.

Opt into Suspense with one line at the call site (`use(user.promise)`); leave it out to keep inline loading UI. Both shapes are supported from the same hook.

## Install

```bash
# State only
npm install @supergrain/kernel

# State + API queries
npm install @supergrain/kernel @supergrain/silo
```

The React bindings ship in the same packages (`@supergrain/kernel/react`, `@supergrain/silo/react`) and require `react >= 18.2`.

## Also available

- **[@supergrain/mill](./packages/mill/README.md)** — MongoDB-style update operators (`$set`, `$inc`, `$push`, `$pull`, `$addToSet`, `$min`, `$max`, `$unset`) for batched, path-aware writes. Optional — plain `store.x = 1` is the usual path; reach for `mill` when you want to apply several updates atomically or use dot notation for deeply nested writes.
